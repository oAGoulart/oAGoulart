### Keep thyself credible
1. Thou shall not declare with no type.
2. Thy function shall not return any type.
3. Thy class shall public no attributes.
4. Thy code shall need no comments.
5. Thou shall declare no needless test.
6. Thou shall debug with no print.
7. Honour thy branch and thy fork.
8. Remember the pull, to keep it wholly.
9. Observe the push, to keep it wholly.
10. Thou shall not merge thy neighbour's branch.

_You shall set up these stones, which I command you today, on your lab._

> For apart from inquiry, apart from the praxis, individuals cannot be truly human. Knowledge emerges only through invention and re-invention, through the restless, impatient, continuing, hopeful inquiry human beings pursue in the world, with the world, and with each other.

â€• Paulo Freire, Pedagogy of the Oppressed

Thus, one _truly_ human beign does not lend his or hers inquiry, praxis, to a thought-replacing machine. The anti-human machine, AI.
